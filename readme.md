# Busy Light

![Image of the busy light control boxes](./pictures/20.jpg)

This repo contains the schematics, PCB files and media for a synced busy-light
control box that can be used to communicate up to 4 states, indicated with LEDs.
The wireless communication is fault-tolerant and utilizes encrypted ESP-NOW for
communication, which means that it doesn't have any other dependencies besides
power and your communications are secure!

## Schematic and PCB

## Tools required

- Screwdriver
- Small eyeglasses screwdriver
- Soldering iron
- Solder
- Solid core wires
- Wire stripper
- Arduino IDE
- Kicad

## Assembly notes

- Use blue and white leads for button switches
- Use 150 ohm resistors for all LEDs
- For the Arduino IDE, you will need the
  [ESP8266 library](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) installed
- Epoxy putty around the cable is optional but recommended!
- To order the boards from JLCPCB yourself, visit the releases to download the
  compiled gerber files
- The boards are set to 9600 baud serial
- Use serial to determine the board's mac addresses
- Then, fill in `BROADCAST_ADDRESS[]` with both boards' mac addresses
- Toggle the `#if true` between true and false to flash corresponding boxes
- (Optional) Set a new 16 char encryption key for better security

## Repository structure
- `busy-light-1.0.0/` contains the original prototypes I made with protoboards
- `busy-light-1.1.0/` contains the fabbed version of the board
  - There's not enough clearance for the micro-USB cable, so you will have to file
    down the head of the cable or find a lower-profile connection
  - Getting the stranded-core wires through the holes is really annoying, I need
    to make the holes a bit bigger
- `busy-light-1.2.0/` contains a new version that should be easier to solder and
  have better WiFi reception, but hasn't been fabbed yet

## Potential future changes
- Flip the ESP8266 for more clearance for regular micro-USB cables
- Enlarge the holes or find a better connecting solution for the stranded core
  wires
- Add mounting for PCB (Mounting holes?)
- Add mounting for Micro-USB cable
- Use FreeRTOS if I feel like writing a lot of boilerplate

   a usable internal pull-up on D0. Something to keep in mind!

## Misc Notes

- Vf red led button: 1.87v @ 3.4v
- Vf yellow led button: 2.58v @ 3.5v
- Vf green led button: 2.54v @ 3.6v

---

- Vf red: 1.84v @ 3.7v
- Vf yellow: 1.92v @ 3.8v
- Vf green: 2.30v @ 4.0v

---

- (3 - 1.85) / 20 (milliamps) * 1000 = 57 ohm
- (3 - 2.6) / 20 (milliamps) * 1000 = 20 ohm
- (4 - 1.85) / 20 (milliamps) * 1000 = 108 ohm
- (4 - 2.6) / 20 (milliamps) * 1000 = 70 ohm
- 150 ohm resistors seem good enough
